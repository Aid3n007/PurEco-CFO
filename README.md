**PurEco CFO: Aiden Schwab**

-------------------------------------------------

Hello Everyone!!! I am Aiden Schwab, the CFO of PurEco. I focus on the company's financial affairs ensuring that the needs for our product have been met.  
As the CFO, my goal for the company is to regulate spending for both the product and our employers as I am responsible for the financial actions of the company. These are to acquire funding for projects, construct strategy with the board of directors and my fellow CEO, analyze financial data and evaluate the information to craft appropriate budgets, and ensure the company growth through financial stability.
