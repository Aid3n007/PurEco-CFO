**PurEco CFO: Aiden Schwab**

-------------------------------------------------

Hello Everyone!!! I am Aiden Schwab, the CFO of PurEco. I focus on the company's financial affairs ensuring that the needs for our product have been met. 
 
As the CFO, my goal for the company is to regulate spending for both the product and our employers as I am responsible for the financial actions of the company. These are to acquire funding for projects, construct strategy with the board of directors and my fellow CEO, analyze financial data and evaluate the information to craft appropriate budgets, and ensure the company growth through financial stability.

Additionally, overseeing the financial flow of the company with strategic oversight of both me (CFO), the CEO, and CTO will not only push our product further into development, but to ensure that the company has a fighting chance at providing the best possible products. Not only that, but to satisfy investors and guarantee quality products on the market to fit our range at financial stability.
